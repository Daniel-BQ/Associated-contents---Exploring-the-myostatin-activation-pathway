# Associated-contents---Exploring-the-myostatin-activation-pathway

This associated contents is referent to the work "Exploring the Myostatin Activation Pathway: A Promising Target for Treating Muscle Atrophy". It is disponible all inputs used for simulate the systems, calculate the proprierties and the outputs for the last 100 ns of each system simulated.

The file "MD_protocol.zip" presents the inputs for MD simulation employed on the work (*.in files) and the protocol used for all simulations (job_MD.csh file). The protocol was fully described on the methodology section of the article.

The files Promyo.7z, latent-complex.7z, TLD-p1.7z, p1-inter.7z, TLD-p2.7z, p2-inter.7z, Inactive-MSTN.7z and Active-MSTN.7z have the topology (.prmtop) and the parameters file (.inpcrd) of each system. Futhermore, it was disponibilized the last 100 ns of simulation for each duplicate for all systems that was used for analysis on the work.
